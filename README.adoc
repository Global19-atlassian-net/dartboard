Dartboard is an Eclipse plugin for https://www.dart.dev/[Dart] and https://flutter.dev[Flutter] development.

== Features

Thanks to the language server protocol and the analysis server provided by the Dart team Dartboard already contains many features.

=== Rich Text Editing

The language server provides the necessary analysis and TextMate grammars provide syntax highlighting to enrich the development experience.
